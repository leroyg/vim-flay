Vim Flay
========

Vim Flay analyzes structural similarities within Ruby code and reports code
that is structured similar. This is a great way to find code that is prime for
refactoring. Ruby is well known for DRY code practices and *vim-flay* helps
locate code that appears to violate the DRY principle.

Vim Flay attempts to be unobtrusive yet informative. The plugin will mark a
number of lines where code is too similar and when the cursor is placed on
line with a mark there will be a subtle status message within the command bar.

Note, *vim-flay* ignores the naming of variables and functions and only
analyzes code structure for similarities.

Requirements
------------

First and foremost, *vim-flay* requires the installation of *flay* which is a
Ruby gem. Assuming you have Ruby installed, you can install *flay* like so,

```bash
$ gem install flay
```

Secondly, *vim-flay* assumes you have compiled *vim* with Ruby support. Many
*vim* installations come with Ruby support already enabled. You can check your
installation with the following command,

```bash
$ vim --version | grep ruby
```

If you see `+ruby` then you are good to go. If not, you can check your operating
system's requirements for installing *vim* with Ruby support. If you are an
Ubuntu user you may not have Ruby support out of the box, but you can easily
install a version of *vim* that does,

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install install vim-nox
```

Finally, *vim-flay* requires `+signs` support. Vim Flay uses signs to mark
lines within Ruby source code. Most installations of *vim* have sign support
but you can check your installation to be sure,

```bash
$ vim --version | grep sign
```

If you see `+signs` in the output there is no problem.

Installation
------------

With the requirements out of the way all you need to do is install the plugin
itself. If you are a Pathogen user you are in luck because this plugin is
Pathogen friendly. All you need to do is drop this plugin in your `bundle`
folder and you are good to go.

```bash
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle/
$ git clone https://github.com/prophittcorey/vim-flay.git
```

If you don't have Pathogen set up I highly recommend you check it out. It saves
a lot of headaches when installing *vim* plugins.

Usage
-----

By default there are no mappings. It's up to you to make your own mapping. I
use the following:

    nnoremap <Leader>f :Flay<CR>

The `Flay` command processes the current file and marks any lines with similar
code.

There are a few other useful commands,

1. `FlayClear` clears all marks
2. `FlayToggle` toggles between Flay and FlayClear
3. `FlayList` lists all bad line numbers in the current file

For help within *vim*, use `:help vimflay`.

Configuration
-------------

There are some configurable settings in *vim-flay* which can help simplify the
usage of the plugin. Below are all settings with their defaults shown.

1. `g:flay_on_open` defaults to 0, change to 1 to enable
2. `g:flay_on_save` defaults to 0, change to 1 to enable
3. `g:flay_minimum_mass` defaults to 6, change to any number you prefer
4. `g:flay_piet_text` defaults to ">>", change it to anything you prefer

A note on `g:flay_minimum_mass`. The default is a number I feel comfortable with
but you may find it to be too sensitive to similarities. If that is the case you
may prefer a number like 10 or 16. You can mess with different numbers until you
find a number which fits your preference.

All of these options are configurable in your `.vimrc` file. Below are a few
examples of what that would look like,

```viml
let g:flay_on_open=0
let g:flay_on_save=1
let g:flay_minimum_mass=10
let g:flay_piet_text="âœ—"
```
